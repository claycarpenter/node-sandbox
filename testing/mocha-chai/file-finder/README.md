# File Finder

A simple file search utility.

Created to practice writing unit tests in Node with Chai and Mocha.

Primarily based off of this tutorial:
[Testing in Node.js](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/testing-in-nodejs--net-35018)

## Tests

Run the tests once with `mocha`.

Start mocha and have it continuously run tests using the watch flag:

```
mocha --watch
```
